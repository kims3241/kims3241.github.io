 Up until recently, my majoring was just going to be Accounting. After taking several accounting classes and interning at a CPA firm, I realized that I absolutely didn't enjoy imaging my future as an accountant. I came to this realization a little too late and thought I would just get my BA in accounting. After talking to several people, I thought it would be better for my to double major. I wanted my second major to be revolved around computers. I always had a passion for computers and thought that I could be able enjoy working at a job that revolves around one of my few interest. A friend recommended me that I should double major in accounting and MIS since I've gotten so far into the accounting curriculum.
